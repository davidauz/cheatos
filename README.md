# cheatos
Simple game cheater for the awesome game Generation Zero written in pure C.

Many programs of the like operate continuously updating a memory location where the target quantity is stored.

This one instead modifies the executable machine code where the update is done.

At present it only does infinite ammo and infinite life; the interface is brutal, only a small window and two checkboxes.
