# cheatos
Simple game cheater for the awesome game Generation Zero.

Written in pure C, uses AOBs so at least part of it should work across different versions.

There is no interface; it injects into the running process and then waits for numpad keystrokes.

It showcases some techniques like dll injection, codecaves, inline assembly etc.

Precompiled binaries available in the release section.
